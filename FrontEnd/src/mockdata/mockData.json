      "description": "Lady Jessica indicates we are not prepared for what is to come, but the sight of Timothée Chalamet riding a sandworm is enough to get us headed to the movie theater, where director Denis Villeneuve's sequel will become the first big-screen event in a year that will feel the effects of the 2023 strikes. Survivors of the first movie will reassemble as Paul Atreides looks to avenge his father's death and prevent a future only he can see. A totally smooth and menacing Austin Butler leads the cast of newcomers as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the nephew and heir of Stellan Skarsgård's Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (who was played by Sting in the '80s). Anya Taylor-Joy is now confirmed to appear in a role that's being kept tightly under wraps. And we see you, Florence Pugh, playing Princess Irulan. We hope you embrace your Bene Gesserit destiny. If Villeneuve can find a balance between action, emotion, and world building, perhaps he'll appease the critics of his visionary salvo with an even more successful sequel.",
